    "description": "A workflow describes a set of **steps** and the **dependencies** between\n\nthose processes.  When a process produces output that will be consumed by a\n\nsecond process, the first process is a dependency of the second process.\n\n\n\nWhen there is a dependency, the workflow engine must execute the preceeding\n\nprocess and wait for it to successfully produce output before executing the\n\ndependent process.  If two processes are defined in the workflow graph that\n\nare not directly or indirectly dependent, these processes are\n\n**independent**, and may execute in any order or execute concurrently.  A\n\nworkflow is complete when all steps have been executed.\n\n\n\nDependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source` field on\n\n[workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and [workflow output\n\nparameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).\n\n\n\nThe `source` field expresses the dependency of one parameter on another\n\nsuch that when a value is associated with the parameter specified by\n\n`source`, that value is propagated to the destination parameter.  When all\n\ndata links inbound to a given step are fufilled, the step is ready to\n\nexecute.\n\n\n\n## Workflow success and failure\n\n\n\nA completed process must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or\n\n`permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a process\n\nexecution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may\n\nchoose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate\n\nimmediately upon `permanentFailure`.\n\n\n\n* If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then the\n\nworkflow status is `permanentFailure`.\n\n\n\n* If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps\n\ncomplete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is\n\n`temporaryFailure`.\n\n\n\n* If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the workflow\n\nstatus is `success`.\n\n\n\n# Extensions\n\n\n\n[ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) and\n\n[SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) are\n\navailable as standard extensions to core workflow semantics.",
